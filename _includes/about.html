        <p>Hey Everyone!, I'm Stephanie Liew, an aspiring, self-taught iOS Software Engineer based in New York. I have a passion for Tech & Creativity. I want to make an impact on peopleâ€™s lives in some way through programming. The lucrative opportunity to learn iOS development without a degree is a rewarding, memorable experience.</p>

        <p>An iOS course sparked my interest to take the mobile development path. The rest was history. I kept learning and coding to a point where I was able to build my own apps. Building on my own was definitely not easy. It was a fun and challenging experience. </p>
